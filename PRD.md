# Product Requirements Document: node-decorators

## 1. Overview

`node-decorators` is a TypeScript library that provides a collection of decorators to abstract away redundant code, keep business logic clean, and improve developer productivity. These decorators can be used to add common functionalities like caching, logging, and validation to methods and properties with minimal code.

## 2. Features

### 2.1. @Cache

The `@Cache` decorator is used to cache the result of a method.

**Requirements:**

*   The decorator shall cache the return value of the decorated method.
*   The cache key shall be generated by concatenating the method's arguments.
*   The decorator shall support the concept of "buckets" to group related caches.
*   If a bucket is not specified, a default bucket shall be used.
*   The cache shall have a default TTL (Time To Live) and check period.

### 2.2. @Log

The `@Log` decorator is used to log information about a method's execution.

**Requirements:**

*   The decorator shall log the method name and a timestamp.
*   The decorator shall have the option to log the method's request arguments.
*   The decorator shall have the option to log the method's response.
*   The decorator shall allow logging of additional custom information passed as arguments to the decorator.

### 2.3. @Length

The `@Length` decorator is used to validate the length of a class property.

**Requirements:**

*   The decorator shall be applicable to class fields.
*   The decorator shall validate the minimum length of the property's value.
*   The decorator shall validate the maximum length of the property's value.
*   An error shall be thrown if the length constraints are not met.

### 2.4. @Async 
*   Async execution decorator.
*   Once a method is decorated with `@Async` decorator, the method should execute in async manner.

### 2.5. @Rest
*   Decorator to expose a function as an API endpoint.
*   Once a method gets decorated with `@Rest` it should be exposed aa an API endpoint with method parrams as request params or body based on method name
    *   If the definition of the method is getResource(Param1, Param2), it should be exposed as /api/resouce?param1=param&param2=anotherparam with `GET` http method
    *   If the definition of the method is addResource/updateResource(Param1, Param2), it should be exposed as /api/resouce with `POST` http method with requestBody as `{"param1": param, "param2": anotherparam}`
    *   If the definition of the method is deleteResource/removeResource(Param1, Param2), it should be exposed as /api/resouce with `DELETE` http method with requestBody as `{"param1": param, "param2": anotherparam}`
